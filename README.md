# Energy_consumption_prediection_IoT_ML


Predicted Energy Consumption in Smart Homes based on which Smart Appliances they used and the climatic and weather conditions in the locality where the house is present. This prediction was done using RNN models - LSTM and GRU. The data was a sequentially timed, as it had recordings of energy consumed by appliances for each minute. 

First the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed. Then, feature engineering was performed and this data was prepared for giving as input to a model. Then the model was built and its training history was plotted to see its performance.
